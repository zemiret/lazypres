# LazyPres

This is WIP.

You can find this project deployed [here.](https://zemiret.github.io/lazypres/)

## What and why?

LazyPres(entation) is for people that would like to share their (travel)
photos in a more entartaining way but are too lazy to create a presentation for it
(it is time consuming, alright?).

So you just upload your photos and if they have a geolocation tags on them,
they will be plotted on a map and their location will be indicated.
Cool and simple, huh?
